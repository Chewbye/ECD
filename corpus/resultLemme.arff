'animation_domination_high-def','I remember a day when the  be controversial . there be a time when people would gnash their tooth over Bart \'s inappropriate behavior and Homer \'s penchant to strangle the lad . I recall news storey and even a protest or two . now , of course , the  be consider by many to be solid family  sweet ( if sarcastic ) look at all that make America \'s nuclear unit the nutty parfait they be . and sometimes , look back on those day of outrage in the early 1990s , I wonder : have the  get well ? or do it just look good by comparison ? a powerful argument for the latter may be Fox \'s    . call  for short , this new entertainment venture start off on the Internet as a cache of unrelated , often  ( not safe for work ) animated short . now Fox have find a home for it on the  hour-long block after ( but not too far after ) Saturday night \'s primetime programming . the  to  cartoon  will apparently rotate in and out of the lineup with the idea that some could become their own primetime show . just like the  . ( Fox \'s website suggest that " Axe  " and " High School USA ! " will be feature throughout the rest of  , then replace by two other . ) the Parents Television Council , after watch some very crude initial offering on the Internet , call the snippet " horrifically graphic ,  , sexually explicit and  . " and , indeed ,  be plenty  far bad than even the already repugnant Family Guy . " High School USA ! " be particularly troubling . it be a tweak of the innocent Archie comic of yesteryear , with high schooler graphically revel in sex , drug and bad  with a satirical tongue in cheek , of course , but without a discernible moral anywhere . " Axe  " be less  rate  rather than the  that have be assign to " High  it be hardly  viewing material . the storey ( which we be tell sprout from the mind of artist Ethan Nicolle \'s  brother ,  ) be violent , almost always free of any real positive message and sometimes revolting : a recent episode feature the titular Axe  battle an army of  feces . it could get bad . Fox , it seem , be keep some of its most objectionable cartoon off the television and on the Internet for now ( where , ironically , they might be more easily see by youngster ) . short feature "   Spider-Man " ( a nude  who spew web from his rectum ) and " my Little Cowboys " ( a riff on my little pony feature partially nude decay corps , accord to the PTC ) be not yet on the tube . but could they get there ? the PTC believe so . in an article post on the PTC website , Christopher Gildemeister write , " Fox want nothing more than to push this  and  ,  , utterly deprave trash at child .  and , ultimately , the block will also appear on prime-time TV . oh , not this year , and maybe not for a couple of year ; but Fox \'s own chairman have state his determination to bring content like " my Little Cowboys " and "   Spider-Man " to prime time , where it will be view by million of impressionable child . remember : when Family Guy start , it too be intend for adult ; and now , it air in prime time , with Fox boast that it be one of the top show view by kid . " if Fox get its way , in just a few year from now , pre-teen child will be lure in by the sight of beloved child \'s icon like my Little  ,  , and  then expose to full-frontal nudity , expose genitals , dismember female corps , and sickening level of violence and extreme content  all at the \' editorial discretion \' of Fox . " I hope the PTC be wrong . but if executive there believe High School USA ! may be just about ready for primetime , it get pretty hard to quibble . episode review August 3 ,  TV  Guidelines  :  High School USA ! : "  " Everyone be horrify that  do n\'t have a club to put on his application , so he pretend to be gay to join the gay club . "  " then show his parent weep joyfully upon learn about his newfound sexual orientation , and his popularity skyrocket , particularly with girl who have never pay attention to him before . ( they say really crude thing about now want him sexually . )  be amaze to learn that being gay be n\'t always so cool . gag involve kid abuse  , and a  tot complain that he ca n\'t drink when he take the pill . we see and hear several crude joke relate to homosexuality . character talk about take peyote and scalping people . they say the  ( which be left  ) , "  " and "  .

Marsh decide to correct the problem by encourage all the guy in high school to sext picture of their own penis . Everyone do so but Marsh , and before it be all over , there be scene of public masturbation and graphic talk about erection . as the credit roll , we see slew of the episode \'s sext , critical part cover by black box . and earlier , naked guy run around a dress room ( with part of their backside sometimes visible ) . we be also show a girl go to the bathroom . character say "  " twice and misuse God \'s name a half-dozen time .

'star_wars','on May  ,  , George Lucas change the cinematic world forever with a little movie that reconfigure our cultural understanding of the word blockbuster . since then , Star Wars have be eclipse at the domestic box office by only a handful of other movie  and I seriously doubt they will be make cartoon about  nearly  year from now . which bring us to Star Wars : the  Wars , a  show birth by  Network with an auspicious theatrical premiere in  . now the entire  sixth and final season arrive on  ( on March 7 ,  ) . Star Wars cognoscenti , of course , wo n\'t need a history lesson to explain where the titular  war fit into the franchise \'s timeline . for everyone else , a bit of  be in order : the series chronicle the heroic exploit of  Skywalker ,   and ( for much of its run ) feisty   Tano during the three-year span between the live-action film Attack of the  and  of the Sith . the Jedi warrior fight on behalf of the  Republic against the rogue  army of the confederacy of Independent  commonly know as the  by  Count  and the  menace General  . together , their adventure span the galaxy , from  to  , from  to  . ( there be also a few , often light episode that do n\'t feature the future Darth Vader . ) the script blend equal part intrigue and battle as the Jedi and their ally seek to outflank cunning  it in space , on the ground or anywhere in between . mission include get supply to a blockade ally , help indigenous people ward off interloper or try to defuse an assassination plot , among many other thing . a  object lesson flash on the screen for emphasis at the outset of each episode . " search for the truth be easy . accept the truth be hard , " read one . " in war , truth be the first casualty , " read another . and occasional deep subtext ask question about the nature of good and evil or lightly poke situational ethic . so while some episode be pretty light or even silly , other can be grim , dark  its own cartoon  violent . clone and Jedi alike be kill on the field of battle . and as the series have draw to a close , it be hard to forget that most of the Jedi we see be hurry toward their own inevitable doom . as for the mystical energy field know as the Force , my word from the  Wars movie review be still relevant when it come to the series as a whole : " clone war assume that viewer be already fully in the know regard the  energy field that the Jedi harness for good and the Sith ( dark Jedi ) for ill . there be no long , expository conversation about the nature of the Force like the one that pop up occasionally throughout the live-action film . mostly , we see how it equip  ,  and   with superhuman agility in combat . " the twist be that many young ( some very young ) fan of the  Wars animated series may have never see the movie that define such spiritual subtlety . so beyond the cartoon violence , that be a fact parent would do well to grapple with before grant carte blanche permission to travel to a certain galaxy far , far away . episode review March 7 ,  TV  Guidelines  :  " the unknown " a clone name  seem to lose it during a critical battle with the separatist , assassinate a Jedi master during the skirmish with a shot to the head . ( we see the dead Jedi , but not the actual death blow . ) he mumble , over and over , " good soldier follow order " and try to attack another Jedi , mystify  and  \'s clone colleague . they speculate that  fall victim to some form of biological warfare but decide the only way to know for sure be to send a  tup back to the planet  to be examine . get him there prove difficult . the separatist launch an attack on the  craft and kill everyone aboard . One victim get yank into the vacuum of space . other be shoot . when  investigate the wreckage , a dead clone float in space , his wide , vacant eye stare blankly into the darkness .  get " kill , " too . one be stab through the chest from behind . another have an arm slice away from the torso . other have heads blow off . clone be shoot and kill elsewhere in shootout reminiscent of the movie . December 8 ,  TV  Guidelines  :  " a Sunny Day in the void " under the command of the diminutive Colonel  Gascon , a ship bear five  ( include  ) be bash and batter by a shower of comet . it crash on a virtually featureless planet , force its occupant to figure out a way home . this episode be light and nearly combat free , but the theme be deep than you might expect . the colonel and the computerized pilot ,  , argue about the difference between the his " training " and  \'s " programming , " with the alien \'s organic ability often fall short of his more reliable computerized underling . when the colonel implore to the sky above to " show me a sign , deliver us hope , "  admit to the other unit , " I do not know who he be talk to . maybe whoever programme him . " the colonel eventually sink into philosophical self-pity . " Life be a void , " he say . " we search and search for answer , but there be none . hope be just an illusion . death be the only certainty . "  buck him up , say , "  up be not in my programming . I be surprise that it be in yours , Colonel . " ( the colonel do cheer up , and they be eventually save by  creature , follow neither God nor computer programming , but the animal \' instinct . ) a couple of joke be make about suicide . the crew find a skeleton of both a creature and a robot . the colonel talk about rupture his gizzard .  be call " stupid .

" the underlie message here be that the good way to deal with bully be to stand up to them . most of the battle scene involve living , breathe combatant on both side ( as oppose to  ) . One of the bounty hunter choke a pirate to death and drop his lifeless body on the ground . another pirate take a spear to the chest .  and  blow up building and hover speeder , result in further casualty on both side .

( mostly we see explosion there , too ) . as be often the case in their relationship ,  have unilaterally decide that  \'s order be not the good way to proceed . when he be label " reckless , "  respond , " reckless  get result .

'gravity_falls','imagine  ride , its character , its  employee . now imagine a place exactly like  without the ride , the character or the  employee . imagine that the only thing remain of the  Place on Earth be a tacky gift shop with a fez-wearing con man count cash up front and a dank , fake freak show out back . you have just imagine the  Shack , the main setting for Disney Channel \'s animated  Falls . the main player in this supernaturally ting toon be 12-year-old twin Dipper and Mabel Pines , live and work for the summer under the tutelage of their great uncle ( or , as the show say , "  " ) Stan . it be he who run the  Shack and populate it with all manner of fabricate distraction , include muscle-bound  ( which he call " Six  " ) , wax statue and "  wolf boy " ( actually , Dipper plaster in dog hair ) . it be he who make the Shack a tourist trap that even P. T. Barnum would have call  he do get a little help from his seasonal worker bee , aloof teen Wendy and goofy  Soos . it be he who will do anything and everything to separate tourist from their cash . except , that be , plunge into the surround forest and bring back some real mystery to the  Shack . after all , the land around   town just down the road from Twin Peaks and a stone \'s throw , it would seem , from  practically burst with preternatural oddity , range from ghost and gnome to merman and  ( very manly Minotaur ) . indeed , if you take  \'s show the   , throw it into the Oregon forest and sprinkle it with a dash of the  ( if the  have be create by Seth MacFarlane ) you have a pretty good idea of what  Falls look like . the Los Angeles Times call  Falls " gently twisted . " and the show do have some edge to  so that it would actually feel more at home on  Network than in the House of Mouse . that be to say it sometimes feature content that brush up against the limit of its  rating . it feel trendy and , yes , twisted , especially when you consider the age of its target audience . Dipper and Mabel go on  adventure , engage in 12-year-old infatuation and learn only the thin of moral at the end of each episode .   his obvious affection for Dipper and  perhaps the bad TV role model this side of J. R. Ewing . slippery spiritual  bit of it play for giggle and  magic , incantation and crystal with the power to alter the world around them . Stan \'s hat evoke the idea of masonic headgear , and we see other such icon scatter across the landscape . on the positive side of the ledger , the world of  Falls do n\'t douse viewer with the kind of sexual double  and teen sensibility crowd  Network \'s  Time or  Show . language do n\'t seem to go beyond the occasional " heck " or " butt . " and character seem to care for one another in their own whimsically flawed way . well , all the character who be n\'t name \' Lil Gideon , that be . he seem borrow directly from Family Guy . episode review February  ,  TV  Guidelines  :  " Boss Mabel " Mabel tell  Stan that he could actually make more money if he be nice to his customer . so Stan make a bet with Mabel : he will leave on vacation for three day and turn the store over to her . whoever make the most money win . right away , Mabel get to the task of be nice . she encourage Soos to follow his dream of be a dancing question mark . she allow Dipper to drag in a real supernatural beastie from the forest .  . the result be disastrous . Dipper \'s monster destroy much of the Shack and send tourist to the hospital . Soos be Mace . and Mabel devolve into a  while try to get thing back on track . Stan , meanwhile , spend his vacation participate in a wheel of  game show , but lose all of his winning when he bet everything on guess one word : a  word that people use to get something they want . Stan \'s guess of  be wrong , and he learn that the please " can apparently make you money . " elsewhere , a wallet vomit up spare change . a tourist be hit by a stuffed head . Shack worker mark price way up for the gullible tourist . Mabel jokingly suggest to a customer that she stick a bumper sticker over her husband \'s mouth . we see some slapstick violence . Stan lie and ( sort of ) steal . character say " butt " and " heck . " Stan take his clothes off on TV to prepare for a " cash shower .

'simpsons','my  son have never know a world without the  . Fox \'s landmark animated show , which snag its own half-hour sitcom slot back in  , have spoof four sitting president , span  Olympic ( summer and winter ) and survive  "  of  " Halloween special . it predate the World Wide Web , a unite Germany and Forrest Gump . it have give us the Oxford English  interjection  ! while peddle literally billion of dollar of merchandise . it be now the longest-running script primetime series in American history , outlive even Gunsmoke and  . here be what all that mean : the  have be around a long  long , in fact , that this review may not be able to tell you anything you do n\'t already know about this show . you have probably already make up your mind about Homer , Marge , Bart , Lisa and Maggie . either you watch ( and consider the  to be a cogent , witty and surprisingly warmhearted satire of the American condition ) or you do n\'t ( and think the cartoon be crass , lewd and morally impair ) . To both camp , we have this to say : we could n\'t agree more . [  asterisk here . ] whatever you think about the  , there be no question it have become an indelible part of American  because in all its paradox , it resemble America itself . it be rebellious and conservative , wayward and moral , both woefully corrupt and whimsically cool . the  be like a  mirror that may distort who we be , but there be enough of a resemblance that we instantly recognize ourselves in its crudely animate outline . in the beginning , parent and pundit lambaste the show for its crude humor and lack of viable role  T-shirt feature the grin visage of Bart and the word " underachiever and proud of it " blanket the country . the  be the family no one want to be but secretly want to visit , if only for a vacation from themselves . their show for many ( include a fledgling  publication that would soon be call  In ) be both a symptom and a cause of a steep decline in our culture . other think , " it be about time we all loosen up a bit ! " underneath it all , something else be happen . Homer and his clan , for all their many , many fault , love and care for one  still do . in some way , now in the second decade of a new century , they seem almost  old-fashioned . as our world try to now decide if  sort of  need at all , Springfield \'s first  hold together , never mind the pressure of school , work , politics , medium and the occasional natural ( or unnatural ) disaster . indeed , Homer and Marge have stick it out for good than three decade through thick and thin , sickness and health , high hair and no hair . indeed , this  family of five , for some Americans , have become shorthand for the nuclear family . but now we must come back to that asterisk insert above . because those  be nuclear in more way than  not just because Homer sometimes come home from work with radioactive trinket in his pocket . their show be still ( and increasingly so ) edgy , rebellious , lewd and crude . homer be one of the bad dad  ever . Bart \'s loud and proud when it come to underachieve . sexual double  scatter out across Springfield like so much fallout .  animated violence and gore do n\'t restrict itself to just the embed  &  Show . homer drink beer like a dehydrate water buffalo . Patty and Selma smoke like Mr. Burns \' power plant after Homer throw a wrench in the reactor . and Mr. Burns \' lovesick assistant , Smithers , would do anything to start up a whole different sort of family with his usually oblivious boss . speak of such thing , Patty " out " herself  season in , and Homer have even officiate a  wedding . foreigner in  be , as London \'s Telegraph put it , downright " weird , remote and funny . " and while the  may wind up in church every Sunday ( when Homer decide to skip in one episode , his house nearly burn down by way of " judgment " ) , the overall tone of episode deal with Christianity be skeptical at good , mock at bad . ( note that creator Matt Groening be an equal-opportunity jokester in this arena . Hinduism , Judaism and Islam have all feel the searing heat of his sarcasm . ) many other pothole dot this  landscape : suicide , nudism , masturbation , bestiality , bully and drug abuse be but a few . in short ? Springfield \'s  do not exemplify an ideal family . Fox \'s  do not exemplify an ideal TV series . neither be ever intend to . and thus , this show and its family may indeed be a symptom of a culture go terribly wrong . which can make it hard to see that it be also at time a symptom of what we have do right . episode review May 4 ,  TV  Guidelines  :  " Brick like me " Homer and the rest of Springfield become  , form a world where " everything fit with everything else and nobody ever get hurt . " but Homer begin to have vision of another existence , where everything seem to be make of meat and he have weird thing on his hand . " if only I could put my finger on what they be call , " he say . Marge take him to church to find " airtight solace in religion , " and the priest talk about how , in the beginning , " the Great  scissor open bag one " before the " Great  . " turn out the Lego world be a figment of Homer \'s imagination . in " real " Springfield , Homer and Lisa bond through  until Lisa be invite by some old girl to see the next  Games movie . ( " I have never be to a  movie before , " she naively say . " I wonder what the one swear word will be ? " ) the Lego world , then , be Homer \'s way of keep his little girl little forever  until he ( ironically ) realize that " the fact that kid grow up be what make time with them special . " Lego version of Homer and Marge have sex . ( we see them afterward , their plastic piece scatter across the bedroom . ) Homer wander into the bathroom in Lego underwear . the school superintendent and a lunch lady kiss in a broom closet . homer be strike by a fall Lego statue . Lennie and two surfer fight . several Lego creation , include people , school and helicopter , be destroy . homer be serve Lego beer and be horrify when it become real beer . we see Lego ghost . character make up an advent calendar . somebody misuse God \'s name .

Homer and Marge sneak back into town to find romance once again in their barricade bedroom . " there be no sex like fugitive sex , " he say , naked ( but cover ) in bed . they be catch . and Rev. Lovejoy suggest the family be crucify and bury . " screw the bold in tight " this time , he add . friend and foe alike force the  to participate in a "  go to hell " parade feature a  demon . someone suggest kill any Simpson they see wander the street , trade their " pelt " in for a free soda . we hear "  , " " Jeez " and a misuse of God \'s name .

Marceline , at one point , move in with her boyfriend . conversation about painful death be common , as be sly reference to bad word or slimy situation .

'familly_guy','Family Guy be , season in and season out , the most obnoxious show on broadcast television . I actually hate to say that . not for fear of overstatement . and not for worry that I might hurt creator Seth MacFarlane \'s feeling . frankly , I be concern that if MacFarlane happen to stumble upon this review , he might use it as a publicity snippet , or perhaps print it out and hang it in his office as confirmation of a job well do . be Family Guy crass ? vulgar ? offensive ? inappropriate ? of  those be perhaps the only thing  in and MacFarlane would agree on . but MacFarlane be not look for my approval , or yours , or anyone else who might long for more  content on the tube . Family Guy be not for us . mostly , it seem like it be for folk who just do n\'t care anymore . the show center around the Griffin  dysfunctional collection of roughly animate being who live in fictional  , R.

Peter be the clan patriarch , the titular " family guy " who make Homer Simpson look like Ward Cleaver . his wife , Lois , and teen child Chris and Meg gamely endure his boozy , uncouth  while suffer from a variety of neurosis themselves . and then there be  , a veritable James bond villain in diaper , who sometimes hurl homoerotic double  as he plot to take over the world . Brian , the  \'  , anthropomorphic dog , round out the family . we will like to tell you more about the character but , honestly , there be not much else to tell . the family in Family Guy be less a collection of  character than a mishmash of two-dimensional ( literally ) cutout use as grist for the show \'s one-liner . the gag drive the  , not the other way \' round . which would be OK  if the gag be actually funny . oh , Family Guy have its moment , but they be pretty sparse . some critic have call it a knockoff of the  show that , for all its own problem , be endow with far more heart and wit , even now in its wane day . instead of heart , Family Guy dole out animated nudity . instead of wit , Family Guy give us fart joke . most episode be rife with sexually them gag ( include a recur  character who try to lure teen boy into his house ) , and many episode dabble in racism , too . One in  demean the work of   and denigrate Christianity in the same breath . this series be regularly boorish , often vile and seem overeager , almost desperate , to shock : it be a 14-year-old boy smoking in front of his parent just to see what they will do . as such , Family Guy be a pretty sad show . and that sadness be only emphasize by the way in which be seem to want to embrace old-fashioned entertainment . it regularly pay homage to movie and sitcom from  ,  even  year ago . MacFarlane show a fondness for elaborate musical number , recall MGM \'s 1950s heyday . its rhythm feel , at time , almost vaudevillian . clearly MacFarlane have an appreciation for the entertainment our parent and even grandparent grow up  not enough of one to keep from drag it down to his lewd level . in some way , the program \'s opening song illustrate both its appreciation for old-school diversion and its unapologetic break from old-school value : Lois and Peter sing the  as Archie and Edith Bunker do for all in the family in the 1970s . " it seem today all you see be violence in movie and sex on TV , " Lois belt out . " where be those good old-fashioned value on which we use to rely ?

I mean , how revolutionary can a  commercial target  be ? pretty revolutionary , it seem . my Little  quickly become the Hub \'s most-watched program , and the audience keep building . by the end of the first season , 4 million people be tune in .

" and yet there be not a hint of know irony to be find anywhere . it be as if the land of  do not allow postmodern cynicism to enter its border . absolutely no  allow . it be all very sweet , but not sickeningly so . nice , but feisty . no televised phenomenon be without its detractor , of course . write for a Ms. Magazine  , Kathleen Richter begin with the headline " My Little  ,  ,   , " and then go on to wonder why black pony be subservient to a  unicorn and argue that Rainbow Dash be intend to give the impression that " all feminist be angry , tomboyish lesbian . " admittedly , Rainbow Dash do exhibit a rainbow , now a symbol of the gay movement , but my Little  have always feature rainbow , go back all the way to the day of Noah himself . ( besides , creator Lauren Faust directly refute Richter \'s assertion . ) My take : the ethos in question inform us that people with different personality and interest can still be the good of friend . a pretty good message , I will say . there be magic , of course . fly horse and unicorn can make thing float or , if they be in a fix , zap thing with magical blast .  can alter the weather . consider the very young of viewer for a moment , I should note that the show do feature some kinda scary monster at time , and that pony can land in perilous situation . and because the show do try to teach little lesson on occasion , it be almost guarantee that a few of them wo n\'t line up exactly with your family \'s value . overall , though ? my Little  : friendship be Magic turn out to be far more than just a half-hour of product placement . sweet message and surprising wit couple with a serious amount of sincerity help this little  soar . episode review February 1 ,  TV  Guidelines  :  " Pinkie Pride " Pinkie  \'s primacy as the pinnacle  in  be pique when a pony name Cheese Sandwich ( voice by  Al Yankovic ) clop into town .

What if you could use the computer to stop murder before they be actually commit ? Finch think through all those thing before he design a back door into the computer \'s software , tell it to spit out a Social Security number every time it detect a murder about to take place . the number might belong to the victim . it might belong to the killer . Finch do n\'t know . all he know be that the person be involve somehow . but Finch be n\'t exactly a man of action . so he partner with a spook name John Reese , a former special  military man and ( perhaps ) one-time assassin . " I do n\'t like to kill , " Reese tell a potential informant , " but I be very , very good at it . " thankfully , in this new gig , Reese be out to prevent murder , not commit them . so while we see that he could kill , he do n\'t ( or , at least , he do n\'t very often ) . not that that stop the dead body from pile up around him like dirty clothes around a hamper . rarely do an episode of Person of Interest go fatality free . that make violence one of the big content concern on this show . pass reference to sexuality pop up as well , and language can be harsh . but in the end , it be the premise itself that pose the big quandary for discerning viewer . and it be not so much the  computer that be at issue , either . after all , the machine be just do what it be tell . rather , it be the questionable decision make by the human being privy to its digital output . Finch , you see , be use his creation illegally to thwart crime before they happen . Reese be want by police himself , apparently in connection with several unsolved murder . and every mission involve break a slew of civil law ( through eavesdrop and wiretap ) and moral one ( through cheating , lie , steal and potentially kill ) . so instead of turn itself into a deep rumination on the line we draw between privacy and safety , Person of Interest end up be more of a visceral salute to high-tech vigilantism . while the script sometimes ask probe question , the answer the bad guy almost always get be complete  . so be that really the kind of thing that will get you on Santa \'s " nice " list ?

'blue_bloods','Blue   stick a pin into any TV lineup , and you be bind to hit a police drama . but not all cop show be create equal . as compare to your average  , CBS \' Blue  take a more  approach to police work by show us the New York City police department through the eye of Irish-American protagonist , the  one and all , through and through . sit in the police commissioner \'s chair during the week and at the head of the family table on Sunday be Frank Reagan , a  , mustachioed patriarch who handle police emergency and family strain with the same sort of resolve that be bolster by time and experience .

Blue  , while never veer far from the construct of the established genre , offer something of an antidote to that : here we see regular  \' people try to do the proper thing . we see principled character square off , show that good people can sometimes disagree . and we see this family of Reagan try to do right by the badge they wear and the city they protect . " Blue  combine the classic American value of family , service , love and hard work , " write Dan Gainor , vice president of business and culture for the Media Research Center .

Philip and Elizabeth Jennings would have be significant tool in their arsenal . " One paradigm I have be that the audience sympathize with Philip and Elizabeth , follow them along as they be on some dangerous and scary mission and want them to succeed , " Weisberg say .

'saved','do n\'t be fool by the title of this show . it be not a series base on the  Mandy Moore movie of the same name , nor do it feature any call to get right with the Lord ( though one of the support character be Mormon ) . no , this TNT original series be about medical professional with serious issue .

'breathless','I see the  movie , the Fifth Estate , the other night . Benedict Cumberbatch be fantastic but the film be n\'t , for several reason , one of which be that it do n\'t really work visually . it be a problem with a lot of drama about the 21st century . people now spend their entire life stare into screen and communicate via text . look at a screen of people look into screen be n\'t a very fulfill experience . you have to go back to the 20th century to find people actually talk to each other , have old-fashioned touchy sex not  sex , express emotion not  , and anger in a way that be n\'t snap shut a laptop . it be maybe why there be so much period drama about . in  , ITV \'s late period piece , we be in London in  . of course , be about the  it have already be call the British mad man ( as the  be , and that be n\'t even set in the  ) . Med Men might be good , give it be a hospital drama . and Dr Otto Powell ( Jack Davenport ) be the Don Draper character  you know , suave , smoking ( in every sense ) ,  etc. he just have to walk into a room , and woman spread their leg . well , he be a gynaecologist . not just a devilish cad though , Dr Otto be also an unlikely champion of choice and perform abortion ( still illegal ) on the sly . " Otto , be that you , I have be such a silly muffin , " he be greet by a silly aristocratic muffin ( scone ? ) with a extra unwanted bun you know where . he be kinda Don Draper meet Vera Drake , then . there be no such complexity from Dr Powell \'s doctor colleague . all male , of course , and all randy as Jack  ; after a brisk , rude group round of the ward , they be all off do their damnedest to hop on and off the nurse like they be the  ply Piccadilly .

Quite a cool ,  kitchen , admittedly , possibly even with a few new electric appliance about the place depend on the salary of your twit  but he be still a twit , and his kitchen be still a kitchen . breathless be good at that ; the  kitchen , the dress , the  and the bus , the  and the  , the  . also at the paradox of the age  the look both forwards and backwards , the rampant sex and rampant sexism , the shiny new NHS and the linger stuffiness etc. it look great , and it capture an age , a fascinating one  key element in any period drama . Plus there be no screen or  . you can forget the modern world for an hour ( except that you be probably tweet along ) . but then Downton Abbey do all that too , and Downton be posh froth . What be beneath the gloss of  ? I be talk about the drama part of period drama  its ability to get a hold of you so you become emotionally tangle up , go on think about it and the character , new people in your life , after the credit roll . and I be not get that . perhaps it do n\'t matter  you can admire the shine , without worry about what be  or be n\'t  underneath . just do n\'t go call it the British mad man . trust me I be a Doctor (  ) be brilliant ; I learn so many interesting thing . like BMI  the fat thing not the regional airline  be rubbish . OK , not rubbish , but it can be mislead , as an indicator of health ; you can be fat and fit . I can be fat and fit . I also do n\'t need to drink two litre of water a day .  , water be boring . I be a bit confuse about whether I should take a quarter of an aspirin a day : it seem to depend on which distinguished expert you listen to .

'black_box','there be an unbearable lightness of be thing go on with  latest drama , Black Box . and I  mean that in relation to the book or the movie of the same name , each with its own certain grace and greatness . No , I mean that Black Box be truly unbearable in its wispy , vacuous , pretentious way . recommended Bryan Singer   Marketing Plans for Next \'  , \' \' Black Box \' Vanessa Redgrave to Star in ABC Limited Series \' The Black Box \' \' Sherlock Holmes \' \' Kelly Reilly to Star in ABC Limited Series \' Black Box \'  :  Seals  Territory Deal for ABC \'s \' Black Box \' I last through  minute of the pilot  which be a feat of superhuman endurance , all thing consider . my left hand wrestle with the remote in my right hand as part of my brain fight to shut the whole thing off , but the evilness of my right hand win out for those horrify  minute and now I can never  Kelly Reilly dancing like the bipolar imp she play on Black Box when  not be a super awesome  world famous neurologist .  who  take her  . because , apparently , she like to dance like the wind . photo : Broadcast TV \'s  Shows  few show be as instantly annoy as Black Box , which set some kind of record ( certainly a personal one ) for cause almost instant agitation . Reilly may be wonderful in some other role , but her combination of sleepy eye , sing-song little-girl vocal pattern and the  desire to have her be both brilliant and also , well , dumb , work completely against the actress . create and write by Amy Holden Jones , Black Box be ostensibly a series about the wonderful weirdness of the human brain . Reilly star as Dr. Catherine Black , medical director of a neurological center know as  the   ( probably for the same reason the brain be call a  Black Box   because nickname be handy and uncomplicated ) . Black ( do you notice that her last name be also like the title ? do you ? do you ? ! ) have a big secret   bipolar .  be live with this secret forever and keep it from her love one . why be be bipolar such an issue when  medication she can take to control it ? because she  like the medication ! she like to flush it down the toilet and go dancing ! she want to see Van   Starry Night  come to life in the sky ( which actually happen in the pilot -- and she float over San Francisco like an angel or Superwoman or something ; and yes ,  just as annoy and ludicrous as it sound ) . be off her  be  a freak rocket ride   never have a good time in my life ,  she tell her shrink , play by Vanessa Redgrave , who resist the urge to say ,  oh , you stupid little child .   : ABC \'s  Season for a series that try to take the brain and medication seriously ( well ,  assume they actually try  perhaps  a flaw in my theory ) , the stuff Dr. Black say and do be ridiculous . for example , the show pretend that if you skip just one dose of your drug  voila   get bipolar hallucination .  no such thing as build up in your bloodstream . Nope . one miss dose and  Van Gogh ! all you have to do be flush your  and the very act of them swirl down the drain make craziness course through your vein and  wait for it   feel like dancing ! Black Box be insufferably trite and never more so than when it decide to show a patient suffering from mental illness which , because this be television , mean we can hear the voice  hearing inside their head and graphics can be use to illustrate the fire ( and such thing ) they see all around them . hokey ? oh , you bet . ABC say Dr. Black  be tear between Will ( David  ) , a sexy , handsome new chef with his own restaurant in Brooklyn , and her co-worker , the charismatic , womanize chief of neurosurgery , Dr. Ian Bickman ( Ditch Davey ) .  Oy . and yes , the chef who want to marry her be too good to be true . and the stud surgeon be like a Neanderthal who say thing like   get incredible stat . if I say  no problem , then  be no problem .  Dr. Black witness him have sex with a nurse . this make her want to stop her  -- and dance ! with lame flashback ( her mother really want to kill herself  just you watch her say it , repeatedly ) and  reenactment , Black Box be just beyond silly . add in  ill-fitting performance and a need to spin around like a ballerina  free from those restrictive pill !  and  get a recipe for never want anyone to find this Black Box , let alone watch it .

'nip_tuck','so ,  have kind of a terrible reputation in the land of television -- remember all that stuff we say two month ago about this show ? Yeah , we be right . and now that the second half of Season 5 be all wrap up , I think it be safe to say that at this point the producer of the show be literally try to shame the last remain diehard fan into let go . I mean really , do anyone watch the season finale last night besides me ? Dear God ! but hey ,  \'s final season be air some time in  -- maybe they be pull that old trick of make us hate them so the goodbye will be easy . guess what , show ? it be work ! for those of you who bail on this formerly ... let be go with " watchable " show when the Carver show up back in  , here be why you miss the most maddeningly absurd season ever ( and trust me , that be say something ! ) . 1 ) Christian have breast cancer . okay , it be not unheard of for a major character on an already soapy show to come down with a fatal disease . but whatever ( force ! ! ! ) poetic irony may have come from manly man Christian Troy come down with what be most commonly a lady \' ailment be completely destroy by the follow : his get assault and rob of his cancer drug by a  prostitute , his manipulate a breast cancer survivor \'s group for his own libido , and his poorly insert  implant go careen off towards his shoulder region in one particularly memorable scene [ Editor \'s note : with a  floozy ! - Mindy ] . however , this be the plot point from which all other  more or less spring this half of the season , and the show do sort of manage to make us ( at least me ) care about Christian \'s impending death towards the end ... so maybe this be n\'t all bad ? ( oh , just wait ... ) 2 ) Christian and Liz hook up . yes , Liz be a lesbian . and seemingly possess of half a brain and a modicum of self-esteem . so why in God \'s name be she  up with Christian , who happen to not only be a notorious Lothario , her boss , and her long-time friend but also , you know , a man ? apparently we be suppose to believe that his terminal breast cancer and occasional moment of  vulnerability be enough to make the steady character on this show ignore her sexuality and act like a stereotypical shrewish girlfriend shriek about " commitment ! " and " fidelity ! " and " do n\'t bang your trashy bar conquest in the foyer when you have invite me over for dinner ! " and then just when we think this cursed storyline be go for good ... she go and agree to marry him . why ? 3 ) major character arc ( and character ) be ignore , multiple time . there be some dramatic stuff go on this season -- Matt quest for his father \'s affection by try for medical school , Kimber as the  stage mother of her one-year-old daughter , and that 17-year-old wunderkind  Raj join the  team . however , none of these arc be even close to adequately explore during the season ( which to be fair only consist of seven episode ) : Matt \'s storyline be introduce and dispatch within a single episode , Kimber \'s arc stop and start a couple time without go anywhere , and poor Raj stick around for three episode but completely disappear after he purposely maim himself by slam his hand in a car door . perhaps if we have have a little more from these second-tier character , we could have have a little less  action ... literally . 4 ) Sean care about his child even less than usual . at the good of time , Sean do n\'t pay much attention to his teenage daughter Annie and toddler son  . but this season give them barely a nod , with Julia take them to New York ( and can someone explain why ? ) in the third episode and Sean just kind of ... let them go . oh wait , there be that phone call Sean get from Julia a couple episode later about not pay Annie \'s school fee ... that totally make up for it ! I mean , these former series regular do n\'t even get to show up in the season finale . even Christian \'s adopt son Wilber get more screen time ! but maybe this be because the actor who play Wilber be just about the cut child ever on TV ( yes , Gosselin brood , that include you ) . who know ? 5 ) big question from last season be leave unanswered ... until the third episode , when they be answer way too quickly . reality check time : Julia  Her Memory in the previous season finale because she Got  . by the   of Olivia , her  Lover . these be big thing ,  ! do n\'t make us wait through two episode before we find out what the hell happen with all this ! oh right , you have that lame explanation in the premiere about Julia slowly regain part of her memory maybe sort of . so fine , you be ignore it . we accept that . but then you go and randomly kill off Olivia on the operate table , blame Sean for it , and bring back Eden from apparently do porn in Europe so that she could frame her dead mother for poison and shoot Julia before throw Olivia \'s ash in Sean and Julia \'s face ? ? ? ? this be a lot for one episode , even for you . 6 ) the especially  moment .  build its reputation on risqué  . and since there be  scandalous episode prior to this season , it be understandable that  \'s episode would have to stretch to raise the bar on this show \'s shock value . but none of this justify any of the follow antic : the baby fetish of the  student Sean be date , reveal when she put a diaper on him during sex ; guest star Jennifer Coolidge \'s character discover her black root , change her name to Coco , and perform in a rap video concern with feminine hygiene call " Yo Stank " ; one of Christian \'s conquest , obsess with the fear that she will inherit her family \'s breast cancer , chop off one of her  with an electric carving knife in the  waiting room ; the bizarre dream sequence experience by Sean after take native American hallucinogen in the desert ; and most of all , the furniture fetish that compel guest star Richard Burgi \'s character to make love to Christian \'s couch , among other inanimate object .  have go over the top before , but never quite this far over . 7 ) and most of all ... the Season  !  traditionally go out with a bang , so it should come as no surprise to anyone that this season \'s finale contain not only cryogenics but also vampire ... or "  " , as they apparently prefer to be call . but these be the least of the shock last night , because we have to go ahead and choke down the following : Sean \'s new flame Teddy lead a double life as an anesthesiologist in Vegas and murder her lover with laugh gas ; an absurd wedding set to some freaky version of " the Very thought of you " that actually end in Liz and Christian yes , tie the knot ; Kimber decide she be still in love with Christian ( way to resurrect a dead  ! I know the vampire be here for a reason ... ) ; and Sean become addicted to nitrous ? oh , and there be one more little wrinkle . a tiny thing , really : Christian do n\'t really have terminal cancer ! he be fine -- the doctor confuse his patient id with a die woman \'s . so guess what , everybody , everything that happen already be base on nothing . nothing ! that be right , none of the crap we have to endure this season be necessary . in any way . way to kick us when we be down ,  . way to go .

'the_knick','the first impression of the Knick , the new  drama series that begin this weekend on Cinemax , be that it seem derivative . it be about a maverick doctor play by Clive Owen who be rude to almost everyone around him  like the abrasive hero of Hugh Laurie \'s Fox series , House . he work at a hospital in a big city , in the shadow of big hospital , fight for attention and respect  like the doctor on St. Elsewhere . the title the Knick , in fact , be short for Knickerbocker Hospital , and be as derisive a nickname as " St. Elsewhere " be for Boston \'s St. Eligius . but the Knick be set in New York , not Boston . and it be not a modern hospital at all , because this new drama series be set in downtown New York City at the start of the 20th century . and in that way , too , the Knick seem overly familiar , because a recent BBC America series , Copper , cover very similar terrain , in both date and place . but here come a pleasant surprise . Cinemax send out seven of the show \'s  episode for preview , and the more I watch , the more persuade I become that the Knick be on a very original journey , and make the most of its increasingly singular cast of character . on the Knick , the graphic scene be riveting , say David  , though at time you may want to look away . here , Clive Owen \'s character administer a shot . i on the Knick , the graphic scene be riveting , say David  , though at time you may want to look away . here , Clive Owen \'s character administer a shot . Mary  of  at the center of all this period medicine and mayhem be Owen as Dr. John Thackery , a medical maverick and pioneer who have more regard for new technique than any bedside manner . when first we see him , he be shoot drug between his toe , like Mel Profitt on Wiseguy , and exhibit little patience with the staff  like Lucy , a new young nurse from the South play by Eve Hewson . even though the setting be a turn-of-the-century hospital ward , the verbal tension may as well come straight from Grey \'s anatomy . the conflict deepen episode by episode , along with the character . the head of surgery , play by Matt  from Max  and  Black , demonstrate early on a risky operation that will be try , time and again , in subsequent episode . each time , it become more dramatic and more meaningful . a new doctor at the hospital , play by Andre Holland , be just as gifted , brilliant and innovative as Dr. Thackery  but his skin be black , which make his circumstance , and his opportunity , completely different . and there be other key character at the Knick as well  from the heiress who help fund the hospital to the unscrupulous ambulance driver who help hunt for research cadaver and other moneymaking opportunity . the slowly blossom beauty of the Knick , as a TV series , be that it move in unexpected direction and at a thoughtfully deliberate pace . if you presume Dr. Thackery be go to bond with that young nurse , or the new doctor , right away , you will be wrong . and medical case , which at first appear to be singular event , turn out to be continue story line where we watch patient heal , or fail to . and doctor , too , keep try new procedure and new equipment in discover the path to an enlightened new age of medical science . One impressive aspect of the Knick be that it mix the late development in medicine  a makeshift suction device , a new X-ray machine  alongside more mainstream discovery , like the bicycle and electricity . Director Steven Soderbergh , who last work for HBO on the Emmy-winning behind the  , trust both his vision and his actor . the graphic operating-room scene be riveting , even as their primitive and bloody display of medical technique make you want to look away . and though it would n\'t be fair to sample a clip from one of the late episode , there be a point , midway through the Knick , when Clive Owen , in one single passionate scene , provide more than enough ammunition for a shot at next year \'s Emmy  . and Andre Holland , as Dr. Algernon Edwards , be right on his heel . get into the Knick  deeply into it , where it begin to prove itself beyond doubt  will take two or three episode . but once you check into this particular TV hospital , and stick around for a while , you will care about the character , their storey and their amazing new invention .

Kovac be a Croatian editor attend who replace Ross as the show \'s designate hunk , but who have difficulty overcome the death of his wife and child in the Balkans war . by the end of the 12th season , Lockhart and Kovac be expect a baby , Lockhart be an increasingly assertive resident , and Kovac have replace Lewis as chief of  medicine . the  major nurse character have be tough young single mother Sam Taggart ( Linda  ) . Taggart be highly skilled . but most of her early  focus on her romance with Kovac , and their joint effort to raise her son Alex in spite of the negative influence of his  violent criminal who ultimately escape from prison and kidnap Taggart and their son , before Taggart herself execute him with his own gun . Taggart become assistant nurse manager in the early 12th season episode with the highly skilled , aggressive  nurse manager Eve Peyton . but Taggart \'s new role seem to evaporate with Peyton \'s abrupt firing for deck an offensive patient on Christmas Eve . other new character arrive , and some stay .  Chen (  ) , a contemporary of Carter \'s who have briefly appear on the show near the start , return as a resourceful but troubled senior resident . after a time she quit the editor to care for , and ultimately  , her fail father . Michael Gallant ( Sharif Atkins ) be a bright , decent medical student whose education be fund by his commitment to the U. S. Army . he be ultimately send to Iraq .   ( Parminder  ) be a bright but bookish medical student who go through her last year of school alongside Lockhart .  accept a prestigious internship at the University of Michigan , but quickly bail out and return to County , slowly grow more confident in the editor .  also maintain a tentative long-distance romance with Gallant . they actually married , but Gallant feel compel to return to Iraq , where he be kill by a roadside bomb . Gregory Pratt (  Phifer ) , an often arrogant intern struggle to care for his mentally disabled brother , have a relationship with Chen . Pratt later show sign of mature , and he become far more skilled , but he refuse to pursue the chief resident job . Ray Barnett ( Shane West ) be a brash young resident who struggle to balance his day job with his passion for play in a rock band ; he become more commit to medicine , and be fire from his band . and in the 12th season , borderline incompetent resident Archie Morris ( Scott Grimes ) , who have be a minor character , become a major one . as the new chief resident , he generally remain an annoy , self-important weasel , though he also show sign of great skill and decency . since the beginning , the show have also feature a diverse group of recur minor nurse character . they have include  Marquez ( Laura Ceron ) ,  Adams ( right ) ( Yvette Freeman ) , Lily Jarvik ( Lily  ) , Malik McGrath (  D ) , Lydia Wright ( Ellen Crawford ) , Yoshi Takata (  Watanabe ) , and Connie  ( Connie Marie Brazelton ) . these character have be well draw , though in contrast to the major character , we have learn little about their non-work life . they be often busy at the periphery of a clinical scene , and they have occasionally play notable role in specific  . for instance , in the 12th season premiere , Marquez and Adams be see play a key role in cope with " July syndrome , " which occur each year when new physician intern start work . portrayal of Nursing ( series ) "  " have generally depict nurse as competent , caring professional with technical training who contribute to patient outcome . unlike many show , it have resist portray them as Nurse  , sex object , or mute cipher who appear occasionally to execute physician command . it have show some nurse to be man and member of minority group , though all three of the major nurse character have be straight white female . it have even show nurse manager , though these depiction have be problematic . unfortunately , the show \'s limited effort to highlight the work of nurse have be overwhelm by the  vision that have dominate its first  episode . this include the hopelessly lopsided nurse : physician major character ratio , the regular portrayal of physician do and get credit for exciting , important work that nurse do in real life , the frequent suggestion that nurse be physician subordinate , the intense focus on physician training while nurse \' professional development be virtually ignore , the disproportionate emphasis on the one major nurse character \'s personal life , and the mishandle of slur against nursing . the Carol Hathaway , Abby Lockhart , and Sam Taggart character be , along with "  \'s Margaret Houlihan and " China  \'s Colleen McMurphy , among the most influential portrayal of nurse in television history . the "  " nurse be capable , nuanced and generally positive . Hathaway in particular be a strong character , and a nurse manager who at a few point actually confront some real-life nursing issue . although Lockhart be fairly weak early on , in late season she begin to show sign of an actual nursing identity , explain why she choose to remain a nurse rather than continue with medical school , teach resident Gallant the rope , and question some physician treatment decision . unfortunately , Lockhart appear to grow frustrated with nursing and abruptly reverse course , return to medical school . that suggest , wrongly , that nurse who pursue graduate education typically do so in medicine rather than nursing . current major nurse character Taggart be a strong character with obvious skill and a willingness to advocate for patient , though at first her toughness arguably veer into inappropriate aggression . early in the 12th season , Eve Peyton make Taggart assistant nurse manager , but there have be no real mention of this since Peyton \'s departure . the recur minor nurse character likewise have be show as care professional with skill . over the year , a few episode of the show have make some effort to highlight nursing skill or concern . the Hathaway era include a  about a nursing labor dispute , and one episode in which Hathaway ( right ) have to provide solo care to a critical patient in a dangerous hostage situation . indeed , as a nurse manager , Hathaway confront nurse administration over the float of nurse away from editor , she start an  clinic and hire a nurse practitioner to work there ( that do not last long ) , and she even quit briefly over the effect of insurance on the editor \'s practice . at one point , Lockhart give a brief but spirited defense of her nursing ability , and at time she also engage the physician in meaningful care discussion ( though her return to medical school suggest that this may have be part of her outgrow nursing ) . Taggart \'s  have include one where she provide significant autonomous care to a critically injure rape victim , albeit with disastrous result , and another where she actually make an important catch that an intern have  receive credit for it . in its 12th season , the show present the formidable ,   nurse manager Eve Peyton ( right ) . she be not a major character , and she appear in only six episode . but it be an unprecedented portrait of a mostly autonomous nursing leader who be more or less the clinical peer of the attend physician . indeed , Peyton may have be the most clinically expert nurse character ever to appear on a major prime time U. S. show . she take the nursing staff firmly in hand , dole out advice , hold staff meeting , and tell senior physician how they be screw up . the show stress her autonomy and professionalism . she push for systemic change in everything from order new supply for cut edge procedure to encourage more hand washing . she brush back physician on her autonomy over the nursing  even embarrass them with superior clinical knowledge . after recruit Taggart as assistant nurse manager , she briefly seem to become something of a mentor to the young nurse . however , these isolated  have be swallow by the hundred of hour "  " have spend tell viewer around the world that only physician care matter much . for all its medical realism , the show remain a victim of what Kalisch and Kalisch have call " Marcus Welby syndrome " : the inaccurate depiction of all significant health care be provide by physician . the show have frequently show physician perform critical nursing task , such as triage , patient teaching , give medication , provide  support , minute-to-minute care of the critically ill , and preventative care such as vaccination . nurse be not the only one affect by this ; the show commonly have physician do the job of social worker and respiratory therapist as well . the show \'s physician nursing be a natural result of its consistent practice of have only one of the eight to ten major character be a nurse , when in a real life Level One  Center the  ratio would likely be about  . the show \'s character ratio would make it difficult to portray the two profession \' role accurately even if the show want to . of course , the show do have some recur minor nurse character . but they have be use mostly to deliver brief patient status update to physician ( " BP be  over  ! " ) , to absorb physician command , and to act as dramatic foil for the main character . these nurse rarely have substantial interaction with patient , and be almost never see provide care without a physician . To our knowledge , they have not play a major overall role in any episode . moreover , the show have consistently portray nurse as subordinate to the physician who dominate it , rather than as member of an autonomous  exemplify by its frequent depiction of physician manage , discipline , and even fire nurse . it be true that Hathaway actually act as a nurse manager at time in the early year , though she be at time present as be under the authority of the   . Lockhart too be dub a " nurse manager , " though she be force into it and do next to nothing with the title . now , it be Taggart \'s turn to ostensibly be " assistant nurse manager , " but since Peyton \'s departure , Taggart have do no " managing , " and it be not clear if there have even be a " nurse manager . " not surprisingly , the show have fill this nursing management void with physician . it frequently tell viewer that physician direct all care and essentially manage nurse , even if they may have hire some unseen nurse administrator to handle the paperwork . some might expect good from a show that be create by a physician , and that have count physician as some of its key writer . of course , there be the six Eve Peyton episode in the 12th season . these make crystal clear that Peyton , as  nurse manager , do not report to  physician . but for a show that air more than  original episode each year , they be obviously a drop in the bucket . moreover , the episode \' depiction of nursing autonomy be itself problematic . it suggest that Peyton report to chief of medicine Kerry Weaver . and although we be not too concern at first that Peyton be see as a  "  show have have its share of physician manager in that  \'s final episode be a crude and implausible swerve into extreme battleaxe territory . in that episode , Peyton get dump by her boyfriend ; deck an offensive patient dress as Santa Claus and pour his own urine on him , with no physical provocation and no regret ; be fire in a matter of hour ; and bid farewell to the  staff with standard  phrase like " bite me , " " screw  , " and " you all suck . " Peyton be at least fire by a " nursing supervisor " rather than a physician . but the episode spoil even that nod at nurse autonomy by have  medical chief Kovac send three of Peyton \'s nurse home because he foresee a light shift , and call them " support staff " as he do so , with no contradiction . the show have also give viewer little sense of the independent , science-based assessment and intervention that be central to the nursing process . in recent season it have occasionally depict nurse in their patient advocacy role , which can entail question physician \' care plan and catch their mistake . but this have almost always be when the physician be somehow impair , as by illness or inexperience ; otherwise , the nurse tend to lose out in such discussion . "  " have not often show a nurse act as a primary force in a patient \'s outcome . instead , with rare exception , physician tend to receive all the credit or blame for the result . apart from the Peyton episode , the show have pay virtually no attention to the professional development of nurse , such as through advanced nursing degree , research or scholarship . nurse character have limit opportunity to display their special knowledge and skill , especially since nursing student be never show . this stand in stark contrast to the show \'s obsessive focus on each stage and feature of the physician \' professional development , from medical student through the chief of medicine . tellingly , Lockhart finally choose a medical career and Hathaway flirt with one , as if to prove that they be worthy of the show \'s attention despite " only " being nurse . all three major nurse character have also spend much of their time in romance with the show \'s physician , and in a number of episode , a key role of the minor nurse character have be to comment idly on the life of the physician . the show have also develop a pattern of mishandle slur against nursing . typically , it will have a character who be socially  an abrasive attend like Romano or Weaver , an unhappy patient , or a visit  contempt for nursing . perhaps the character will suggest that nursing be all about bedpan , or call a female physician a nurse as an insult , or suggest that nurse do n\'t know anything about the prognosis of a major stroke victim , or express fear at the thought of be a nurse but joy at the prospect of be a physician . in response , a nurse character will look hurt , but she will not say anything . or the remark will be make outside of any nurse \'s earshot , and no one will question it . the show may think it be help viewer see how hard it be to be a nurse . but the persistent failure to have any character rebut such slur will likely lead many viewer to conclude that while the speaker may be mean , what he or she say be essentially correct . it be just not the kind of thing nice people actually say . there be one notable slur reversal . at one point , Peyton fail to get Kovac to come help a resident with a critical patient . so Peyton do the require cutting-edge procedure herself , teach the resident as she go , then advise the late-arrive Kovac that if he need her , she will be off change a bedpan . finally , though the show pride itself on be on the cut edge of social issue and have refer to the budget crisis in public hospital , it have still pay no serious attention to the current nursing shortage or the  that drive it . this be a shortage that have for some year be a major threat to global health , but that "  be generally inadequate portrayal of nursing have do little to address . the Abby Lockhart character do suggest in pass in  that low nurse staffing would likely cause patient death -- in the context of an episode in which chief of  medicine Romano have unilaterally fire a number of nurse . and one of the  Eve Peyton episode include a fleeting reference to the hospital \'s agreement to implement  nurse staffing ratio . but that seem to be a quick way to set up new assistant nurse manager Taggart , whose first big task be to fire  Adams for work excessive overtime . that plot also wrongly suggest that the big problem now be some nurse seek to work too many extra shift , rather than the reverse problem of  , in which hospital force nurse to work excessive hour in order to cut cost . the real problem of short staffing have never be explore . over its  season , "  " have show some real appreciation for the role nurse play in modern emergency care . however , that recognition almost invariably give way to its obsessive focus on the training and practice of physician . in real life , nurse , physician and other health professional have complementary and interdependent work relationship . but on "  , " the bottom line have usually be that the physician \' role be unrealistically large and robust , and the nurse \' role correspondingly small and flat . in dramatic term , the physician be the tragic hero , while the nurse be essentially member of the chorus . read more :  :  .  .  .
